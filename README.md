# Anomaly-detection

      - Project Title: Rare Class Prediction through Anomalay Detection
      - Analytic Objective: To create One Synergized Analytical Framework for different Business Application domains.
   
Prerequisites:
==============
      - Install RStudio (Tool used: RStudio Version 0.98.1091 – © 2009-2014 RStudio, Inc.)
      - Install Python 3.6 (Tool used: Anaconda Navigator: Spyder 3.2.3) 

Data Resources:
==============
      - Used BayesiaLab (vehicle accidents) public data for study and research purpose.   


Code Short Desctiption:
=======================
  Python Code
  -----------
    - Allow to clean and treat the raw dataset for modeling.
    - Used Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) metric to evaluate classifier output quality.
    - Used Area Under the Curve (AUC) models to predict the best classes.

  Python: Models used inside the code
  -----------------------------------
    - Variable Standardisation : One-Hot Encoding, Z-Score
    Models :
    -   Logistic Regression
    -   Naive Bayes, GaussianNB
    -   LocalOutlierFactor
    -   Oneclass SVM
    -   Isolation Forest

  R code
  ------
    - Allow to clean and treat the raw dataset for modeling.
    - Impute missing values
    - Used below mentioned models to predict the best fit.

  R: Models used inside the code
  -------------------------------
    - Semi-supervised AEN
    - Semi-supervised Method 1: One-Class SVM
    - Unsupervised Method 2: K-Nearest Neighbor + Density
    - Bayseian Network
    
 # Note:
    - Run the scripts as per the step number mentioned infront of each python and R script
