Business Application across Four Domains And One Synergized Analytical Framework

Prerequisites:
Things you need to install and how to install them

R code
------------------------------------------

Allows creation of Bayesian Belief Networks
and other Graphical Models with pure Python
functions. Where tractable exact inference
is used. Currently four different inference
methods are supported with more to come.

Models Used
--------------------------

- Bayesian Belief Networks with discrete variables
- Gaussian Bayesian Networks with continous variables having gaussian distributions
